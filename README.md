# Random-CSS-SVG-Background
Inspired by SVG patterns gallery https://philiprogers.com/svgpatterns

Easily add more Base64 encoded SVG into the JS array of images and it will be randomly chosen as the background of the page.

There are many SVG backgrounds freely available online, but I am just keeping to the default ones from "SVG patterns gallery" here.
